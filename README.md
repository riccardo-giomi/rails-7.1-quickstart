# Rails 7.1 quickstart

A template for Rails 7.1 with a starting Gemfile lineup, configuration and a
simple theme.

It allows to quickly create a new application and just start developing simple
applications, saving some time on the same tooling and configuration every time.

This template also tries to overhaul the scaffolding system of Rails, providing
a theme and additional logic, to try and make scaffolding able to create an
acceptable application from scratch.

## The Base template

At the moment there's only one template: it creates a new Rails application with
SQLite, TailwindCSS, Import Maps and StimulusJS, and RSpec.

It also adds Gems and configuration for common tools like RuboCop, sets up Slim
as the template system for Rails views, and configures scaffolding to use what I
consider a pleasent CSS Theme (YMMV).

More information and installation instruction can be found [here](templates/base/).
